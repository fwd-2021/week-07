    <h2>Research Prospectus</h2>
    <p>
      This document outlines the core topic areas and a selection of planned and in-progress
      projects that constitute the next three years of my research agenda. As of Fall 2020, I will
      conduct this research as a full-time tenured associate professor in pursuit of eventual
      promotion to full professor in the Department of Information Technology and Management, in the
      new College of Computing at Illinois Institute of Technology.
    </p>
    <p>The primary contributions of my research are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        to create innovative field- and industry-leading practices and methodologies for web
        development based on the leading edge of published open web-standards, and
      </li>
      <li>
        to better educate and professionalize current and next-generation web developers.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Taken together, my primary research contributions improve the professional status and
      expertise of web developers, leading to improvements in the overall stability, sophistication,
      and accessibility of the web. My research closely aligns with research in information
      technology not only in its technical subject matter but also in its relevance to both industry
      and higher education. As with all of my existing published work, my research will continue to
      address directly those who teach and lead others along a broad continuum of mentoring and
      instructional situations, including formal university education and lifelong, continuing
      education expected of professional developers.
    </p>
    <h2>Core Assumptions and Approaches</h2>
    <p>
      Web development as a professional practice is pulled in opposite directions by two
      unsustainable, contradictory extremes: one extreme is marked by inertia and stagnation, and
      the other by instability and fragmentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first extreme, web developers and certain behemoth frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, jQuery,
      and Drupal—to name prominent front- and back-end examples) perpetuate, often unwittingly, web
      development practices inextricably entangled with outdated hacks, antipatterns, and
      browser-specific workarounds. Virtually all of the practices and concepts found at this
      extreme were, at an earlier time in the web’s history, unavoidable side-effects of doing
      development in a browser landscape rife with incomplete and incompatible implementations of
      JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM), and even HTML and CSS. In spite of the web
      gradually maturing in recent years to include widespread, cross-browser support for web
      standards (that is, the <i>recommendations</i> issued by the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C,
      as well as true standards published by Ecma International, ISO, and other groups), outdated
      web-development practices and techniques remain widespread today in routine development
      approaches and, worse, continue to be perpetuated even in university and professional
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other extreme, web development warps and fragments into instability signaled by crowds
      of developers making leaps from one framework or development methodology du jour to the next,
      at a breakneck pace. Knowledge of a framework becomes the defining developer ambition and end
      in itself. Next to the burnout that developers report experiencing in trying to maintain such
      a pace, the most professionally dire side-effect of this extreme is developers claiming to
      “know” a framework but not the language it’s written in or the protocols and APIs the
      framework touches: the developer who claims, “I know React, but not JavaScript,” for example.
      Developer efforts to stay current with the latest, most fashionable frameworks means the
      neglect or abandonment of bedrock principles and sensible, user-centered constraints—such as
      usability and accessibility—that are fundamental to web development. Among the most important
      principles that are missing from developer practice at this extreme are progressive
      enhancement, graceful degradation, and the separation of concerns inherent in the web’s three
      core front-end languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual professional education and practices of individual web developers, of course, are
      to be found between those two extremes. But unsurprisingly, developers themselves are
      routinely pulled in opposite directions by parallel extremes of inherited legacy codebases or
      functional requirements to support ancient browsers like Internet Explorer 7, on the one side,
      and managerial demands or requirements listed in job ads, on the other, with companies
      sometimes demanding that applicants to web-developer positions have numerous years of
      experience with particular web frameworks or development methodologies that are themselves
      sometimes only months old. (Yes, that really does happen.)
    </p>
    <p>
      At the broadest scope, my research is an applied investigation into the extremes of stagnation
      and fragmentation in web development. I examine and analyze the shortcomings of lingering bad
      practices and hastily developed new practices, always with regard to new and emergent web
      standards that also inform my approaches to course design and classroom instruction. In short,
      I produce innovative research that improves the practices of working developers and enhances
      the core curricular objectives and outcomes in university settings.
    </p>
    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <p>
      The projects below all build on my twenty-year research record in the areas of web standards
      and web design and development. Each of the research projects below directly addresses or
      considers questions and problems of pedagogy with regard to the professionalization and career
      tracks of students pursuing web development or adjacent areas of computing and information
      technology. A few of the projects here also consider the development of industry-connected
      university faculty—especially those who are themselves professional developers first, and
      faculty second.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Book: <cite>Pragmatic Teaching & Mentoring</cite>.</b> Currently in its proposal stage
        for submission to Pragmatic Programmers, this peer-reviewed book will fill a tremendous need
        for providing guidance to developers who find themselves engaged in a broad range of
        activity that resembles teaching and instruction, including mentoring, delivering conference
        presentations and workshops, and teaching formal college-level classes. I’m writing the book
        with ITM’s own industry faculty in mind, as well as former students who write me from time
        to time with questions about how to mentor and teach. This is a book for people whose
        primary professional work and identity are tied to industry, but who also lead others
        through instruction. To provide sound, actionable guidance for this group, the book is
        anchored in cultural-historical activity theory and threshold concepts. But rather than
        wading deeply into explicit theory, it offers pragmatic advice derived from theory and my
        own professional practice. I specifically discuss how to structure, conduct, and self-assess
        mentoring sessions, conference presentations, and classroom assignments and course designs.
        For managerial and educational settings that include assessment and review, I provide
        guidance in establishing instructional and educational approaches that value collaborative
        learning and formative assessment in addition to, or as a complete substitution for,
        traditional forms of summative assessment.

      <li>
        <b>Short book: <cite>HTML Antipatterns</cite>.</b> This short peer-reviewed book, intended
        for publication with leading web-development press A Book Apart, will catalog and
        demonstrate vastly improved alternatives to hundreds of real-world examples of poor HTML
        usage. Much of the attention in front-end web development is paid to exciting advances in
        the CSS specification (CSS Flexible Boxes, also known as Flexbox, and CSS Grid, for two
        recent examples) and in the EcmaScript and Document Object Model specifications. With far
        less fanfare but no less importance, HTML and its specification continue to advance, and
        browser-makers are steadily improving and expanding their implementations of the HTML
        specification. Developers’ actual use of HTML, however, tends to be stunted by the
        persistence of old habits and unstudied practices that result in <i>antipatterns</i>:
        widespread but ineffective, even deleterious solutions and responses to common, recurring
        problems. I have been collecting and documenting examples of antipatterns found in the wild
        on the open web as well as in student work from years of teaching web development to
        students with a very wide range of preparedness. I have also been in contact with a
        significant figure in the web-standards movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, to
        explore collaboratively authoring this project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Conference presentations and collaboratively written articles: Fitting web curricula to the
        web-development stack.</b> I have been collecting and studying peer institution examples of
        how to better fit web courses and curricula to the full stack of web development. This project
        is derived from my ongoing work with faculty on a subcommittee of ITM’s Curriculum Committee
        charged with modernizing the graduate and undergraduate web curriculum, including the
        structure and requirements for all web specializations, minors, and certificates. This
        research project’s central problem is determining how solid or porous the borders should be
        between front- and back-end courses, and how and to what degree back-end concepts should be
        introduced in front-end courses, and vice versa. In the near term, I plan to propose an early
        version of this work for presentation at SIGITE, but it will take its final form as a small
        series of articles—ideally written collaboratively with other ITM faculty on the
        web-curriculum subcommittee.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Specification development: ARIA in HTML.</b> This project is a direct contribution to the
        Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) in HTML specification (<a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/"">https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/</a>), whose most
        current working draft was just published on February 15, 2020. I will be actively
        participating in the specification’s open development: monitoring and responding to posts on
        the specification’s GitHub Issues tracker; crafting and submitting pull requests to improve
        the language of the spec; and testing and reviewing the results of the specification’s
        conformance-testing suite against the specification itself. This project extends in new ways
        my long-time research interests in accessibility, as well as my professional ambition to
        directly contribute to the development of open specifications, which my research is heavily
        reliant upon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Group-authored article with graduate students: WebRTC.</b> In Fall 2020, I will be
        teaching a course on the Web Real-Time Communication Between Browsers 1.0 specification (<a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/</a>, WebRTC), which
        finally achieved Candidate Recommendation status in December of 2019 (the specification has
        been in development since May of 2011). I will use that class in part to work towards a
        publication jointly authored with graduate students, who will work with me on compiling an
        extensive bibliography of secondary materials on WebRTC for publication as a bibliographic
        essay or extended literature review in a topically appropriate IEEE or ACM journal. We will
        include in the project detailed notes and caveats that highlight points where secondary
        sources deviate significantly from the Candidate Recommendation version of the
        specification, which has changed in significant, backward-incompatible ways over its nearly
        decade-long development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Open-source contributions: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).</b> Finally, I plan to more
        frequently review and contribute content for the industry-leading web documentation at MDN.
        I have previously contributed to the documentation’s running text as well as its code
        examples and compatibility data, and I intend to become more actively present on MDN both to
        serve the broader web-development community and to model for ITM students the importance of
        contributing to the maintenance and expansion of accurate,  well crafted documentation sets.
        I will also actively encourage and mentor graduate and advanced undergraduate students
        looking to make their own MDN contributions.
